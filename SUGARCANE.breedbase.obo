About 9 to10 months after inoculation, five stalks from each individual plots in plant cane crop are randomly selected and cut near the ground. Then 15 cm long basal portion from each of the five stalks consisting of an internode is cut and cored from the internode using a 1-cm diameter Cork borer. The core piece is cut into 1-cm section and placed into the custom-made plastic holder (holding a nitrocellulose membrane placed on the top of a blotting paper). The plates are centrifuged at 1300 G for 10 minutes. Centrifugation makes vascular bundles imprints on the nitrocellulose membranes and bacteria deposits in the imprints. After tissue-blot immunoassay, vascular bundles colonized with bacteria turns blue. These blue dots per 1-cm section are counted. Average of number of colonized vascular bundles (CVB) is calculated"
